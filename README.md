# What is Quantitative Education Research?

This repo contains the code and some explanation for a workshop I conducted for master's students that walked them through the process of conducting survey-based quantitative education research. I used the PISA survey to demonstrate. The workshop contained additional data files, so the code will not run on its own, but it can still be a useful example.
